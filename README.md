# Social website--Djanog-React-DRFW-simpleJWT

I created this website from scratch using : Django,Djangorestframework,React,simpleJWT

# Feaatures of the website:
1- authentication system
2- ability to create post
3- ability to like/unlike post
4- ability to comment to post
5- ability to follow/unfollow other users.
=> all of this done without refreshing page

to run the code:
1- donwnload it but don't foget to add node modules with necessary packages in order to react to work.
2- run python manage.py runserver , as i integrated both of frontend and backend together in order to make both of them run with this command.
